## Abstract

This EIP proposes a standardized way to associate executable scripts with existing token contracts that do not implement ERC-5169 and cannot be updated or modified. It introduces a decentralized registry that maps token contract addresses to script URIs without relying on a centralized database. This approach allows for the enhancement of tokens with client-side scripts to extend their functionality in a fully backward-compatible and non-invasive manner.

## Motivation

With the increasing functionality of tokens, especially in contexts like DeFi, gaming, and NFTs, there is a growing need for tokens to support associated client-side scripts. ERC-5169 addresses this by allowing token contracts to provide a `scriptURI()` function. However, many existing tokens cannot be directly upgraded to support this. ERC-5170 aims to provide a solution for these tokens to be associated with scripts, enhancing their functionality and user experience.

## Specification

### Registry Contract Interface

```solidity
interface IERC5170 {
    /// @notice Event emitted when a script is associated with a token
    event ScriptAssociation(address indexed token, string[] scriptURI);

    /// @notice Associates a script URI with a token contract.
    /// @param token The address of the token contract.
    /// @param scriptURI The array of URIs pointing to the scripts.
    function associateScript(address token, string[] calldata scriptURI) external;

    /// @notice Fetches associated script URIs for a token contract.
    /// @param token The address of the token contract.
    /// @return An array of script URIs associated with the token.
    function getScriptURI(address token) external view returns (string[] memory);
}
```

### Implementation Guidelines

- The registry MUST be deployed on multiple EVM-compatible blockchains to support cross-chain functionality.
- Any address MAY call `associateScript` to register or update the script URI for a token. This is a deliberate design choice to maximize flexibility and inclusivity.
- The `getScriptURI` function MUST return all associated scripts for a given token. It does not enforce or check the authenticity or safety of the scripts, leaving that responsibility to user agents or other verifying mechanisms.

### Use Case Example

1. A user or developer discovers a token contract from an older or less flexible deployment that lacks script interaction.
2. They deploy a script that enhances the token's functionality and wish to make this script available to others.
3. Using ERC-5170, they associate this script with the token's contract address by calling `associateScript`.
4. Other users can then discover and interact with this script via a compliant wallet or interface that queries the `getScriptURI` function.

## Rationale

The decision to allow any party to associate scripts with any token address is intended to maximize utility and adoption. While this approach has risks (such as the potential for spam or misleading scripts), these are considered outside the scope of this ERC. The focus is on providing a decentralized, blockchain-agnostic mapping system.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-5170 is designed to be compatible with all existing ERC token standards and does not require modifications to existing contracts. It operates independently and can be used alongside any token standard.

## Security Considerations

- Users and user agents should verify the authenticity and safety of scripts obtained through ERC-5170 mappings. This ERC does not provide mechanisms for script validation.
- There is a risk of incorrect or malicious script URIs being associated with token addresses. User agents might implement additional filtering or reputation systems to mitigate this.
